# MaterialMatch AI - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a modern AI SaaS web application called "MaterialMatch AI" that helps architects and interior designers analyze inspiration images and match them with similar materials/products from uploaded catalogues. The app focuses on material analysis, visual similarity matching, and material sourcing workflows. NO rendering, 3D editing, vendor scraping, marketplace, or CAD integrations.

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React 19 + React Router 7 + Tailwind + Shadcn UI + Sonner toasts
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Motor (async MongoDB) + JWT (httpOnly cookies)
- **AI:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) via `emergentintegrations` (Emergent Universal LLM key)
- **PDF Reports:** Client-side using jsPDF + html2canvas
- **Catalogue PDF parsing:** PyMuPDF (fitz) - converts up to 6 pages per PDF into images
- **Storage:** Base64 in MongoDB (sufficient for MVP)
- **Typography:** Cabinet Grotesk (display) + Satoshi (body) via Fontshare
- **Design language:** Swiss & High-Contrast Architectural Minimalist - white/neutral, soft shadows, bento grids

## User Personas
- Interior designers, Architects, Material consultants, Furniture studios, Design firms

## Core Requirements (Static)
- Authentication system (JWT, email+password)
- Project workflow: create → upload → analyze → report
- Reference image analysis (materials, colors, textures, finishes, style)
- Catalogue matching with similarity scores and explanations
- Downloadable PDF reports
- Modern premium SaaS UX

## Implemented Features (2026-02-26)

- ✅ Upload page (drag/drop ref image + catalogue PDF/images + prompt)
- ✅ Analysis page (live polling, sticky reference card, palette, materials, matches grid)
- ✅ Report page (multi-page PDF download, print-friendly)
- ✅ All 26 backend tests passing (auth, projects, uploads, analysis pipeline, reports)
- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4.5 vision integration end-to-end verified
- ✅ Background task for AI analysis with status polling

## Prioritized Backlog

### P1
- Multi-page report layout improvements (page breaks at sections)
- Project rename/delete from dashboard
- Catalogue item pagination/lazy loading for large libraries (50+ items)
- Forgot password / reset password flow

### P2
- Team workspaces & sharing
- Vendor/SKU tagging on catalogue items
- Stripe billing (Studio free / Practice $49 paywall)
- Google OAuth social login
- Save/star favorite matches
- Comparison view (side-by-side reference vs matched product)

### P3
- Object storage migration (out of MongoDB base64)
- Parallel LLM calls (asyncio.gather) for faster analysis on big catalogues
- Server-side PDF generation (ReportLab) for higher fidelity prints
- Multi-tenant brand customization
